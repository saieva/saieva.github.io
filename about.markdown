Greetings. I am a Technology Manager in the NY / NJ / CT areas. My career experience is in financial services and
healthcare leading IT Groups, Application Development teams, and managing technology initiatives for hedge funds,
banks, a global insurance company, and clinics specializing in orthobiologic treatments and regenerative medicine.
I've established digital capabilities for multiple startup businesses and I've been a Divisional CTO for a
Fortune 100 company.

I am the developer of MettleCVE, a vulnerability lookup tool for iPhone that's available on [The Apple App Store][MettleCVEAppURL].

I am an active Mentor in [NYU's Tandon School of Engineering Management of Technology Graduate Degree Program][NYUMoTURL].

I work independently and I am available to join your enterprise or startup project as a Technical Advisor or Software Consultant.
I can fill an interim leadership role for your most important application and IT initiatives as CIO or CTO.

I have trained dozens of teams and managed hundreds of projects using Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming,
and Lean. I am reasonably current in several programming languages and infrastucture automation technologies and I can
complement a team as an individual contributor when needed.

Perspective matters, and if you're looking for someone to bring simplicity, predictability, and long-term regularity to your most
difficult technology and application initiatives, contact me on [LinkedIn][SaievaLinkedInURL].

Regards,

Sal.<br>
