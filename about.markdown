Greetings. I am a Technology Manager in the NY / NJ / CT areas. My career experience is in financial services and
healthcare leading IT Groups, Application Development teams, and managing technology initiatives for hedge funds,
banks, a large global insurance company, and clinics specializing in regenerative medicine.

I am the developer of MettleCVE, a vulnerability lookup tool for iPhone that's available for download from the
[Apple App Store][MettleCVEAppURL].

I am a active Mentor in [NYU's Tandon School of Engineering Management of Technology Graduate Degree Program][NYUMoTURL].

I work independently and I am available to join your enterprise or startup project as a Technical Advisor or
Software Consultant. I am reasonably current in several programming languages and infrastucture automation technologies
and I can complement a team as an individual contributor when required.

I am experienced in training dozens of teams and managing hundreds of projects using Agile methodologies such as
Scrum, Extreme Programming, and Lean. I can fill an interim leadership role for your most important application and
IT initiatives as a CIO or CTO.

If you're looking for someone to bring simplicity, repeatable predictability, and long-term regularity to your most
difficult technology initiatives, contact me on [LinkedIn][SaievaLinkedInURL].

Regards,

Sal.<br>
