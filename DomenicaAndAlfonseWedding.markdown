My Mom and Dad, Domenica and Alfonse, were married in St. Leonard's R.C. Church in Brooklyn, NY on August 5, 1962.
Their wedding reception was held at Saieva's Parkview Manor, my family's catering hall, also in Brooklyn on Knickerbocker Avenue.

Their wedding album was in a beautifully crafted box with an 8x10 image of my Mom framed on the inside cover.
Photos were taken by Imperial Studio, Brooklyn, NY. All photos that follow are digitized from 10x10 pictures
from their wedding album.
