Here’s the method demonstrated by Jim Lahey in this New York Times video interview
with Mark Bittman.

Here’s the book that describes the no-knead bread baking method in detail with
lots of recipes: My Bread by Jim Lahey [http://a.co/d/03JtIb1][MyBreadBookURL]

If you don’t have the book, here’s the basic recipe. Use measurements by weight
for the best results: [https://gatherjournal.com/recipes/jim-laheys-no-knead-bread][JimLaheyRecipeURL]

An 11-inch Dutch Dough Whisk works very well for mixing: [http://a.co/d/0e8LlyK][DoughWhiskURL]

And a Lodge 2-Quart Cast Iron Dutch Oven is just the right size for cooking one loaf: [http://a.co/d/hBYvFzV][DutchOvenURL]

And find a digital kitchen scale that measures in grams. This Amazon Basics model gets
the job done: [https://amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Stainless-Digital-Batteries-Included/dp/B06X9NQ8GX/][DigitalScaleURL]

And here is one example of my results, using all the recommendations above.
