If you're just getting started with no knead, sourdough, and dutch oven bread, here's a cheatsheet for
everything you need to make great artisan style crusty rustic bread at home.

- &#9881; Here’s the method demonstrated by Jim Lahey in this New York Times video interview

- &#x1f4d6; Here’s the book that describes the no-knead bread baking and dutch oven method in detail with lots of great recipes:
    - **My Bread** by Jim Lahey [http://a.co/d/03JtIb1][MyBreadBookURL]

- &#x1f4d6; If you don’t have the Lahey book, here’s the basic recipe. Use measurements by weight for the best results:
