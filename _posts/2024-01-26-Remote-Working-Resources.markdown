### *IMPORTANT: This post is in draft form, updates are not yet completed.*

The list of resouces on this page should be useful to many people in a variety of circumstances:

- if you are a manager responsibile for a distributed team.
- an individual wanting to improve your effectivenss when working independently.
- a CEO/CTO/CIO or other C-level executive trying to get your head around how much face-to-face time you need with your employess,
and how much you think they need with each other.
- an HR Manager trying to navigate a thick fog of emotions whille being empathetic to creating company policies that are fair to everyone.

The materials are organized by their sources. There are playbooks that are more prescriptive, articles that describe how-to methods,
opinionated blog posts, and a (highly recommended) book that attempts to tie together the big picture of managing a fully remote company
with details of using online tools to collaborate. Each source includes some commentary to help you decide where to start or
if a particular item is worth your time.

It's unlikely that any one source will give you all the answers. If you're trying to improve an existing and already functioning
remote working model, then you may be able to pick-and-choose ideas from blog posts and articles. If you're starting from scratch,
the book and playbook references are likely what you'll need. You know your situation so choose materials that fit the scenarios on
your team or in your company the best.

Something to know, the references from 37Signals are different. Jason Fried (CEO) and David Heinemeier Hansson (CTO) operate a
*remote only*company and have written extensively on their management approach. If you're looking for novel ideas and a different
take on remote work, deep-dive into what 37Signals have to say.

#### **37Signals**

[37Signals][37SignalsWebsiteURL] develops and sells the [Basecamp][BasecampWebsiteURL] project management system,
[HEY][HEYWebsiteURL] email and calendar, and the [ONCE][ONCEWebsiteURL] set of applications; millions of people rely on
their software to run their businesses. The company operates on a completely remote basis and they have a lot to say about the benefits
of working this way. They've written a book and many blog posts about their viewpoints and remote working methods.
Their approach is (partly) summarized by idea #11 from the [37Signals][37SignalsWebsiteURL] Website:

> Don't emulate the office\
> Work remotely, not locally apart. Don’t just have the same meetings on Zoom, have fewer meetings.
> Rather than discussing everything in real-time, communicate asynchronously instead.
> Rather than feel the need to know where everyone is, let go and trust more.
> Don’t try to emulate the office and everything it stands for — stand against it.

#### **Google**

Google's People Innovation Lab took a more scientific approach to remote work and managing distributed teams. Their research analyzed the make-up
of meetings involing two or more buildings, cities, and timezones. A set of 1-page playbooks were written for Distributed Employees,
Buddies of Distributed Employees, Managers, and Leaders.

> At the same time, we did hear from Googlers that working with colleagues across the globe can make it more difficult to establish
> connections — in many senses of the word. Coordinating schedules across time zones and booking a conference room for a video chat takes
> more logistical brain power than dropping by a coworkers desk for a meeting over coffee. The technology itself can also be limiting —
> glitchy video or faulty sound makes impromptu conversations that help teammates get to know, and trust each other, seem like more
>trouble than they’re worth.

> But if your video and microphone are always muted, people can't see or hear if you're engaged in the meeting.
> Gilrane recommends that you put in a little extra effort to reinforce that you're listening.
