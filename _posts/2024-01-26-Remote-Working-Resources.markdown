[37Signals][37SignalsWebsiteURL] is the company that develops and sells the [Basecamp][BasecampWebsiteURL] project management system,
[HEY][HEYWebsiteURL] email and calendar, and the [ONCE][ONCEWebsiteURL] set of applications based on a pay-once and self-host purchase model.
Their company operates on a completely remote basis and they have a lot to say about the benefits of working this way. So much so that they have
written a book and many blog posts about their viewpoints and remote working methods. The approach is (partly) summarized by idea #11 from the
[37Signals][37SignalsWebsiteURL] Website:

> *Don't emulate the office*\
> Work remotely, not locally apart. Don’t just have the same meetings on Zoom, have fewer meetings.
> Rather than discussing everything in real-time, communicate asynchronously instead.
> Rather than feel the need to know where everyone is, let go and trust more.
> Don’t try to emulate the office and everything it stands for — stand against it.
