Designers Jony Ive and Marc Newson recently collaborated on a collection of objects,
some chosen and some designed and manufactured by them, for an auction supporting
Bono’s (PRODUCT)RED brand and charity. [Charlie Rose interviewed][CharlieRoseYouTubeVideoURL]
and toured the Sotheby’s auction floor with them.  While the discussion was interesting in
several ways, comments by Jony Ive on his motivations for design are deeply thoughtful and inspiring:

> “I think, one of the things, that you get a sense of is the **degree of care**. How much did this group
> of people care to make this and make it right. And they didn’t do it for themselves, it’s **in service
> to the people** that are going to use or buy the product.
>
> And I think there’s something, **the humanity** of that, I think is extraordinary. But I do think,
> as Marc was saying, how something’s finished on the inside, you can argue that you’ll never see that.
> But I think, we believe, and it’s very difficult to explain why, but I think **part of the human
> condition is that we sense care**.
>
> And sometimes it’s easier to realize you sense carelessness. And I think we’re surrounded,
> our manufactured environment, so much of it you know, testifies to a complete lack of care.
> Which isn’t, you know, that’s not about your attitude toward an object, **it’s about your attitude to each other**.
>
> And so I think that sort of commitment and passion become fanaticism of just really caring to
> get something right whether you’re going to see it or not. But we **do that for each other**.” *- Jony Ive, Apple, Inc.*

That is exactly the perspective that makes Jony Ive, and Apple, great.
The quote comes at approximately 16:50 in the video interview.
