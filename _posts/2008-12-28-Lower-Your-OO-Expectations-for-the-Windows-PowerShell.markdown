For programmers who are used to leveraging object oriented techniques, even within modern scripting languages,
don’t expect too much from the Windows PowerShell. Here’s a quote from the PowerShell Online Help file:

```
Class

Definition: Declares the name of a class, as well as a definition of the variables, properties, and
methods that comprise the class.

Although it is possible to create a class in Windows PowerShell, it’s not a very straightforward process and
definitely goes beyond the scope of this introductory manual. So, for the time being, forget we even mentioned it.
```

Yep, that’s a verbatim quote. PowerShell is still a verision 1.0 product so hopefully the
situation will improve in future versions of the software.

If you’re looking for more documentation for the Windows PowerShell, here are some references.

The [Windows PowerShell 1.0 Documentation Pack][WindowsPowerShellDocPackURL] includes a getting started guide,
a user guide/primer, a quad-fold reference card, and release notes for version 1.0.

Microsoft has a .chm Help file for PowerShell which is a convenient (and searchable) reference to
supplement the PowerShell online Get-Help CommandLet. They refer to the .chm Help file as the
“Graphical Help File” which you can download by clicking [here][WindowsPowerShellHelpFileURL].

O’Reilly publishes a [pocket reference][OReillyPowerShellPocketReferenceURL] which is a very good source of
information for the Windows PowerShell if you are an experienced programmer. They also publish
the [Windows PowerShell Cookbook][OReillyPowerShellCookbookURL] for the language which is in the standard
O’Reilly Cookbook format that is available for other programming languages.

The [Windows PowerShell Technology Center][MicrosoftPowerShellTechCenterURL] has many other helpful resources
if you are getting involved in PowerShell Programming.

The next version of PowerShell, version 2.0, is available in a Community Technology Preview (something
like a beta version) by clicking [here][MicrosoftPowerShell2TechPreviewURL]. And hopefully future versions of
PowerShell will provide better support for object oriented freatures of the language.
