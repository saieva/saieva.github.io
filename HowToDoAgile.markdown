Here are the recommendations I make, and the approach I've used at multiple companies and with dozens of teams,
to instill an Agile culture and establish the day-to-day processes for using Scrum, Extreme Programming, and Lean.

1. Read the Four Agile Values: [https://agilemanifesto.org][AgileManifestoURL]
1. Watch the Agile Product Ownership Video (15 minutes)
   - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE][AgileProductOwnershipYouTubeURL]
1. Read the Scrum Guide (13 pages): [https://scrumguides.org/index.html][ScrumGuideURL]
1. Read the 12 Agile Principles: [https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html][AgilePrinciplesURL]
1. Identify Roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Scrum Team)
1. Identify Work (Backlog and Sprint 0)
1. Set Schedules (two week Sprints, 15 minute Daily Standup)
1. Coach... Coach... Coach...

**Book Recommendations**

> Agile is not a process. Agile is not a fad. Agile is not merely a set of rules. Rather, Agile is a set of rights, expectations, and
> disciplines of the kind that form the basis of an ethical profession. -Robert C. Martin, [Clean Agile: Back to Basics][CleanAgileBookURL].
