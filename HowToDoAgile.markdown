Here are the recommendations I make, and the approach I've used at multiple companies and with dozens of teams,
to instill a culture and establish day-to-day working methods for using Agile.

1. Read the Four Agile Values: [https://agilemanifesto.org][AgileManifestoURL]
1. Watch the Agile Product Ownership Video (15 minutes): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE][AgileProductOwnershipYouTubeURL]
1. Read the Scrum Guide (13 pages): [https://scrumguides.org/index.html][ScrumGuideURL]
1. Read the 12 Agile Principles: [https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html][AgilePrinciplesURL]
1. Identify Roles
1. Identify Work (Backlog and Sprint 0)
1. Set Schedules (two week Sprint, 15 minute Daily Standup)
1. Coach... Coach... Coach...
