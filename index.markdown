This is Saieva.com, the personal Website of Sal Saieva. You can find my career history on [LinkedIn][SalSaievaLinkedInURL] and
how I can help your startup or enterprise project on the [About page][SalSaievaAboutURL].

I created [MettleCVE][MettleCVEAppURL], a vulnerability lookup tool for iPhone, to help Security Remediation teams fix cybersecurity
issues faster. You can see a quick 35-second demo of the app [here on YouTube][MettleCVEYouTubeDemoURL].

> A baseball manager recognizes a nonphysical talent, hustle, as an essential gift of great players and great teams.
> It is the characteristic of running faster than necessary, moving sooner than necessary, trying harder than necessary.
> It is essential for great programming teams, too. Hustle provides the cushion, the reserve capacity, that enables a
> team to cope with routine mishaps, to anticipate and forfend minor calamities. The calculated response, the measured effort,
> are the wet blankets that dampen hustle. -Frederick Brooks, [The Mythical Man-Month][MythicalManMonthURL].
