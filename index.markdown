This is Saieva.com, the personal Website of Sal Saieva. I am an independent IT and Software Consultant.
You can find my career background on [LinkedIn][SalSaievaLinkedInURL] and ways I can help your startup or
enterprise project on the [About page][SalSaievaAboutURL].

I created [MettleCVE][MettleCVEAppURL], a vulnerability lookup tool for iPhone, to help Security Remediation Teams and
Information Security Professionals access patch information to fix cybersecurity issues faster. You can see a short 35-second
demo of the app [here on YouTube][MettleCVEYouTubeDemoURL].

Interested in Agile? Colleagues and friends frequently ask me how to get started with Agile for their projects and with their teams.
The recommendations I've shared and used over-and-over-again are consolidated here on the [How To Do Agile][HowToDoAgileURL] page.

> A baseball manager recognizes a nonphysical talent, hustle, as an essential gift of great players and great teams.
> It is the characteristic of running faster than necessary, moving sooner than necessary, trying harder than necessary.
> It is essential for great programming teams, too. Hustle provides the cushion, the reserve capacity, that enables a
> team to cope with routine mishaps, to anticipate and forfend minor calamities. The calculated response, the measured effort,
> are the wet blankets that dampen hustle. -Frederick Brooks, [The Mythical Man-Month][MythicalManMonthURL].
