#### **Fractional CTO / CIO and Hands-on Technology Leadership**

This is Saieva.com, the personal Website of Sal Saieva. I am an independent IT and Software Consultant.
No matter the size of the project or the scale of the problems, I work to achieve simplicity, predictability,
and long-term regularity in the most difficult technology and application initiatives.

Collaboration is the pathway for conducting my work. I will engage with business and technology teams to define digital
strategies, implement product or service modernizations (including for AI feature sets), address tech debt,
extend the useful life of legacy software, or fix an organizational issue or a vendor relationship problem.

And as a hands-on Fractional CTO my schedule is flexible to the specific needs of a project. You can find
my career background on [LinkedIn][SalSaievaLinkedInURL] and ways I can help your startup or enterprise project
on the [About page][SalSaievaAboutURL].

I created [MettleCVE][MettleCVEAppURL], a vulnerability lookup tool for iPhone, to help Security Remediation Teams and
Information Security Professionals access patch information to fix cybersecurity issues faster. You can see a short 35-second
demo of the app [here on YouTube][MettleCVEYouTubeDemoURL].

Interested in Agile? Colleagues and friends frequently ask me how to get started with Agile for their projects and with their teams.
The recommendations I've shared and used over-and-over-again are consolidated here on the [How To Do Agile][HowToDoAgileURL] page.

> A baseball manager recognizes a nonphysical talent, hustle, as an essential gift of great players and great teams.
> It is the characteristic of running faster than necessary, moving sooner than necessary, trying harder than necessary.
> It is essential for great programming teams, too. Hustle provides the cushion, the reserve capacity, that enables a
> team to cope with routine mishaps, to anticipate and forfend minor calamities. The calculated response, the measured effort,
> are the wet blankets that dampen hustle. -Frederick Brooks, [The Mythical Man-Month][MythicalManMonthURL].
